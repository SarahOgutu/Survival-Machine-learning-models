# Survival machine learning models
The project explores the use of machine learning survival models—Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM) and Random Survival Forest (RSF)—
to assess the association between cytokine profiles and HIV incidence. 
The models were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and integrated Brier score (IBS). 
SHAP values were used to interpret variable importance, identifying key cytokines and baseline factors linked to HIV risk. 
## project objective
1. Apply ML models
2. Use interpretable techniques to interpret the model's predictions
3. Asses and compare the ML models' performances.
## Dataset
The data (CAP004) used for this analysis was obtained from CAPRISA (https://www.caprisa.org/Pages/CAPRISAStudies).
